Search for Pentaquark States in Au+Au Collisions at âˆšsNN = 39 GeV with the STAR Experiment at RHIC using Machine Learning Techniques 

In this thesis we present the preliminary results of the analysis of Au+Au $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39 GeV data with the THE STAR detector at RHIC for the search of pentaquark candidates in the $\Lambda K_s^0$ decay channel. We have used the KFParticle code to reconstruct the $V^0$ particles required for this analysis. The KFParticle code is based on Kalman Filter algorithm for reconstructing short lived particles formed during heavy ion collisions. Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) and Multi Layer Perceptron with Bayesian Regulator (MLPBNN) classifiers of TMVA package of ROOT are trained using signal and background trees to help classify signal from background. The invariant mass of $\Lambda K_s^0$ are plotted after TMVA analysis to identify the signals that correspond to the pentaquark candidate.
